# DeepLearning_using_tensorflow
 build Deep Neural Networks models for different business domains with one of the most common machine learning library TensorFlow provided by Google AI team. main focus is on Keras.  Focus on the advanced topics  such as transfer learning, autoencoders, face recognition (including those models: VGG-Face, Google FaceNet, OpenFace and Facebook DeepFace).
